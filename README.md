This repository contains practical examples of all Flexbox properties, a powerful CSS tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and organized examples of how each Flexbox property works, allowing developers to easily reference and test each one.

## Flexbox Properties

Flexbox has several properties that can be applied both to the flex container (parent) and the flex items (children). This repository includes examples for the following properties:

### Flex Container (Parent)
1. **display: flex | inline-flex**  
   Defines the Flexbox layout context.
   
2. **flex-direction**  
   Defines the main axis direction of items (row or column).
   
3. **flex-wrap**  
   Controls whether the items should wrap or stay in a single line.

4. **justify-content**  
   Aligns items along the main axis (horizontal or vertical).

5. **align-items**  
   Aligns items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).

6. **align-content**  
   Aligns multiple rows of the flex container when the available space is larger than needed.

### Flex Items (Children)
1. **order**  
   Defines the order of the items within the container.

2. **flex-grow**  
   Specifies how much the item will grow relative to others.

3. **flex-shrink**  
   Defines how much the item can shrink relative to others.

4. **flex-basis**  
   Defines the item's initial size before the remaining space is distributed.

5. **align-self**  
   Allows modifying the alignment of an individual item.
